# Line Follower Documentation :robot:

## Introduction

Meet **Jerry**, the Line Follower robot with a great personality. Designed to follow dark lines, this robot combines coding with a great sense of adventure. **"Jerry"** possesses a brain (powered by a nano Arduino board), a heart (a trusty battery), and two legs (equipped with motors and wheels). Just like any dedicated racer, it takes a few moments to prepare before starting its line-following journey, after which it run the path with speed and precision.

## Components

- Arduino Nano
- 2 Motors with Wheels
- Infrared (IR) Sensors for Line Detection
- Battery for Power
- Wires and Connectors

## Functionality

### Line Following Algorithm

**"Jerry"** employs infrared (IR) sensors to detect and follow dark lines on a contrasting surface. The line-following algorithm ensures smooth navigation, allowing the robot to stay on course with precision.

### Speed Control

The two motors with wheels provide motion control. The speed and direction of the motors are adjusted based on the input from the IR sensors, enabling the robot to maintain its path and follow the line at an optimal speed.

### Start-up Sequence

Upon activation, **"Jerry"** undergoes a brief start-up sequence, preparing itself for the line-following adventure. This adds a touch of personality to the robot's behavior.

## Operation

1. **Power On:**
   - Turn on the robot using the power switch or button.

2. **Start-up Sequence:**
   - Observe the charming start-up sequence as **"Jerry"** prepares for its journey.

3. **Line Following:**
   - Place the robot on a surface with a visible dark line.
   - Watch as **"Jerry"** follows the line with agility and precision.

4. **Speed Adjustment:**
   - The robot dynamically adjusts its speed based on the complexity of the line-following task.

## Customization

Feel free to customize **"Jerry"** by adjusting the line-following algorithm parameters, tweaking motor speeds, or even adding additional features to enhance its personality.
